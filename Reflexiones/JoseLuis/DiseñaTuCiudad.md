# Diseña Tu Ciudad

**By: Jose Luis Gutierrez Couoh**

I recently volunteered for the "Design Your City" initiative, where citizens vote on public space projects such as sports areas and green corridors. I immediately saw it as a practical case of HCI. The goal is to make a civic process accessible to everyone in Mérida, but designing for such a diverse user base, from tech-savvy children and students to senior citizens, is a huge challenge.

The city uses an online registration system and physical stations where you cast your vote. I was working at one of these stations, and the importance of good design became crystal clear during an incident. A man began arguing loudly, claiming the process was rigged. He didn't understand why he had to provide basic information to validate his vote and thought it was a ploy to influence the results.

His confusion was a direct consequence of a usability failure; the process wasn't transparent enough for him. This quickly led to a catastrophic user experience: frustration, anger, and a total loss of trust. I had to intervene to calm the situation, calmly explaining each step to ensure the person understood the entire process. I explained how the green areas worked. They understood and ultimately cast their vote normally.

Another similar situation involved a woman who didn't want to vote for the green corridors and began to argue because she thought that if a green corridor won, she wouldn't win her park. I had to explain the difference in votes, but this wasn't enough; the woman didn't cast her vote. I believe this was a direct failure of usability. Some people intend to vote for only one public space, and the fact that they are forced to vote for two spaces led some to believe the process was modified, while others were just voting for the sake of voting, which I believe is a mistake.

`This experience showed me that HCI in the public sector goes beyond simple efficiency. A confusing button in a shopping app can lose a sale, but a confusing voting process can damage a citizen's trust in democracy. This demonstrates that a clear, user-centered design isn't just an attractive feature; it's essential for an inclusive and trustworthy civic system.`
