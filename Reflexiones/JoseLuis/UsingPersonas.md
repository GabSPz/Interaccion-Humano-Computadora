# Using Personas

**By: Jose Luis Gutierrez Couoh**

Using Personas in our project has been a very practical way to make user-centered design decisions. It’s more than just a user description; it’s a tool that connects research to the final UI.

Our main persona is "Gavi Siceros", an administrative assistant at the psychology clinic.  From our interviews, we learned her biggest frustration is managing both new appointment requests and already scheduled patients at the same time, often leading to stress and potential mistakes. Her main goal is to have a clear, at-a-glance overview.

`This knowledge directly impacted our UI prototype. Instead of creating a single, long list of patients, we designed a dashboard with two distinct columns: "New Requests" and "Confirmed Appointments." This simple design choice was made specifically for Gavi. It allows her to immediately see what needs her attention and what is already organized. It directly supports her workflow and helps reduce the cognitive load. This is a clear example of how a persona’s needs can guide the design of a more effective and less stressful interface.`
