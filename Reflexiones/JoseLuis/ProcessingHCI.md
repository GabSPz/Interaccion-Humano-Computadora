# Processing HCI

**By: Jose Luis Gutierrez Couoh**

In our HCI class, we’ve learned about Lean UX as a technique to align quality with agile processes. In theory, it’s about reducing waste by focusing on a constant cycle of assumptions, building an MVP to test them, and learning from user feedback. This helps ensure you’re building the right product.

`Reflecting on our team’s project, I don't think our process can be considered lean. We try to be agile by dividing tasks, but we don’t really work with hypotheses. We tend to build a feature almost completely before anyone outside the team sees it. Our “MVPs” are more like unfinished products than true experiments designed for learning.`

`To become truly lean, our team would need a big shift in mindset. It would require more discipline, like setting up weekly feedback sessions with users and defining clear success metrics for each feature. The effort would be significant, and it might feel slower at first. However, the benefit of avoiding wasted work on features that users don't need makes it worth it. It’s a valuable lesson for our future careers, even if it's hard to apply perfectly in a student team.`
