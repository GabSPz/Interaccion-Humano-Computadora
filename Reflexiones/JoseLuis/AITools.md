# AI Tools

**By: Jose Luis Gutierrez Couoh**

AI tools for UI generation are becoming very popular, so I decided to try one to see its real potential for our projects. I used an AI image generator to create mockups for our clinic's app. The experience was impressive; it was very easy to generate visually polished and modern-looking designs just from a text prompt. It's a great tool for initial brainstorming.

However, the quality of the UI is only on the surface. When analyzing the result from a usability perspective, it falls short. The AI-generated designs don't consider essential usability attributes like error states, empty states, or accessibility standards. For example, it produces a perfect-looking dashboard but doesn’t show what happens if the user has no appointments. The AI provides a "happy path," but a real product must handle all the exceptions.

`I don’t think AI will replace UX designers. Instead, the role will change. AI will become a powerful assistant for handling repetitive visual tasks, like generating basic layouts. This will allow the human designer to focus on the more strategic and empathetic parts of the job: deeply understanding the user's context, planning interaction flows, and validating the final product with real people.`
