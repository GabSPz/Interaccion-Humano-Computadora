# Usability vs UX

**By: Jose Luis Gutierrez Couoh**

One of the most important lessons in this course has been understanding the difference between usability and User Experience (UX). While they are related, they are not the same. HCI is the broad field of study, while usability is a specific quality attribute within it, focused on making a system easy and efficient to use. UX is the bigger picture; it includes usability but also covers the user's emotions and feelings about the interaction. 

A specific difference is that usability is about effectiveness, while UX is about emotion.

`In our psychology clinic project, an example of usability is testing if a patient can fill out the appointment request form quickly and without making mistakes.  An example of UX for the same form is whether the professional design and clear language make the patient feel trust and calm while sharing sensitive information.`

`A "UX feature" we could add is a "What to Expect" section after a user books their first appointment. This isnâ€™t about function, but about reducing a patient's anxiety by giving them clear next steps. This improves their satisfaction and perception of the clinic, which is a core goal of UX.`
