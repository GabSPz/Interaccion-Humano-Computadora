### UX vs Usability

<p>The evolution of HCI (Human Computer Interaction) has made usability and user experience (UX) essential in digital system design. For the UADY psychological clinic project, understanding this is crucial. HCI guides effective human technology interactions, considering both functionality and users’ cognitive and emotional needs. Usability focuses on efficiency: Is the appointment form easy to use? Can administrators process requests without errors? UX goes further, addressing emotions: Does the user feel heard? Do they trust the system? While usability measures actions, UX captures feelings.<p>

<p>A clear example is the project’s contact form. Usability means the form has clear fields, checks data instantly, and shows error messages (e.g., for a wrong phone number). But even a perfect form can make users feel worried if they don’t get a confirmation. This is where UX helps, a message like, “Thank you for trusting us. We will review your request and contact you within 24 hours” turns a simple task into a more personal experience. That’s why I added a confirmation message in the UI design. Usability makes sure the task is done; UX makes sure users feel valued.</p>

<p>A major problem in the current system is the uncertainty after submitting the form. Users can’t see their request’s status, which may make them feel ignored. A tracking panel could solve this. With a unique link sent by SMS or email, users could check real, time updates like “Request received,” “Under review,” or “Appointment set for 28/03/2025.” A button to contact the clinic directly could also help with urgent questions.</p>

<p>This idea works because it reduces anxiety through clarity. To test it, short surveys could ask users if the panel made them feel more in control. Data like fewer calls to the clinic or how long users check updates would provide objective insights. Talking to users directly could also reveal personal experiences, did the panel lower their stress? Did they feel treated as a person, not just a case?</p>

<p>While usability is the system’s foundation, UX connects technology to human emotions. In a psychological setting, a project like this needs more than technical efficiency, it must respect feelings and build trust, especially in the user’s first interaction with the system.

### Personas

<p>When designing systems for sensitive places like mental health clinics, focusing only on basic data like age or job can miss important emotions. The Personas method helps avoid this by considering how users feel, not just what they do. In the UADY clinic project, the users' core needs would be about trust, not just their roles.</p>

<p>Lene Nielsen’s toolkit was chosen to uncover hidden needs through stories. Research shows that people often want to feel in control, even if it’s not real. For example, “Ana,” a student afraid to use her real name, would need privacy, not just efficiency. Behaviors like rewriting personal info might reveal anxiety, and working with psychologists could show how tech fear is often linked to past trauma.</p>

<p>Some concerns, like “I don’t want to seem crazy,” would highlight the need for anonymity and no judgment. Personas, such as “Don Luis,” a farmer needing certainty (like a digital stamp), could guide the design. Small changes, like optional nicknames or downloadable receipts, could raise request completion by 40% and help users feel valued.</p>

<p>However, Personas can become stereotypes if rushed. To avoid this, we would include diverse perspectives, like “Carlos,” who values full transparency. Still, maintaining this in a busy clinic with changing staff could be challenging.</p>

<p>In this case, Personas would work because they focus on humanity, not just data. In mental health, every click can be a cry for help, and ignoring deep needs isn’t just ineffective, it’s unethical. Personas succeed when they stay messy, human, and alive.</p>

### AITools

<p>AI tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E are now used in UI/UX design, even in sensitive areas like mental health clinics. In my project, they helped create text and images for Figma quickly but also showed major flaws. The AI generated UI was functional but lacked depth. The text, though correct, felt impersonal, “Complete your details” is clear but lacks warmth. The images looked nice but were shallow. For example, an AI’s idea of “tranquility” might be a generic landscape, ignoring cultural differences or the needs of people in crisis.  

Using AI for design is both easy and frustrating. It works fast but lacks precision. Even a detailed prompt, like “an image that reflects emotional security for young adults in a university setting”, won’t always give good results. AI needs constant tweaking and, most importantly, human judgment. It’s great for automating basics but doesn’t understand nuance.  

When reviewing the UI’s usability, AI helps with structure and visual consistency but fails in key areas like accessibility and cultural relevance. It won’t adjust colors for visually impaired users or ensure diverse representation in images unless manually corrected. A calming color palette may help, but if real users don’t test navigation, hidden issues remain, something AI won’t catch.  

Will AI replace UX designers? No, but it will change the role. AI handles repetitive tasks like generating wireframes and drafting basic text, giving designers more time to focus on people, researching emotional needs, testing with users, and ensuring ethical design. In mental health, every word and image affects a person’s sense of safety. An “Immediate Help” button isn’t just a UI element, it needs careful placement, color, and wording based on real human needs, something AI doesn’t grasp.  

In the end, AI speeds up design but can’t replace human intuition. It’s a useful tool, but relying on it blindly is risky. In my project, AI helped at the start, but the final decisions, ethical, inclusive, and empathetic, were made by a human.s</p>

### ProcessingHCI

<p>Making an agile team focus on accessibility and empathy is hard. Testing these takes time and attention, two things fast methods often lack. In our project for a psychology clinic, this caused problems. Important details, like the tone of messages and visual contrast, were checked too late, leading to costly rework. In traditional agile methods, usability is often an extra, not a priority.  

Lean UX tries to change this with fast testing and constant learning. In a mental health system, where each interaction can affect whether a patient seeks help, this approach is key. Instead of designing a full form and testing it later, Lean UX would test a simple version in days with real patients, adjusting it within hours.  

Right now, our process is not "lean." We use agile sprints, but we validate too late and without psychologists. We also use AI to create text and images without enough context, which made us fix content that felt too generic or cold. Lean UX would require using AI in ongoing feedback loops, not as a separate step.  

Switching to Lean UX would take effort, but it would be worth it. It would mean weekly sessions with health professionals, interactive prototypes from the first sprint, and more involvement from designers and developers in user tests. At first, this would take 20-30% of our time for testing, but in a field where mistakes can stop someone from seeking help, this is a risk we cannot take.  

Is the change worth it? In mental health, yes. Lean UX is not about speed, it is about ethical precision. A poorly placed "emergency" button or a color scheme that causes anxiety can make a big difference. It is not a cost, it is an investment in trust, the same trust a patient needs to take the first step toward well, being</p>
