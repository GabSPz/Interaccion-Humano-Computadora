## UI vs UX

***By Fernando Canul Caballero***

The concepts of UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) are often confused, but they are not the same. UI is about the visual parts of a system, like buttons, text boxes, colors, and layout. It’s what the user sees and interacts with. UX is about how the user feels when using the system, if it’s easy, clear, and helpful. It includes the full experience, not just the look.

In our project for the psychology clinic at UADY, a good example of UI is the screen where patients request an appointment. I created these first contact interfaces in Figma, focusing on clear buttons, simple layout, and using the official colors to make it look trustworthy. After that, I turned the designs into HTML code to make them work on the website.

For UX, we talked to the administrative staff to understand how they work and what problems they face. This helped us build a website that fits their needs. For example, we added features like sorting appointment requests by priority and searching by patient name. These changes make the system easier and faster for them to use, which gives them a better user experience.

## UIDesignPatterns

In our team project, I worked on the first contact screen where the patient requests an appointment. For the design, I used Google’s Material Design UI Kit in Figma. This toolkit includes many UI design patterns and follows clear rules. It helped me keep the design clean, easy to understand, and consistent across all screens.

One important UI pattern I used is the form pattern. This pattern is used when users need to enter and send information, like in our appointment request form. Material Design provides rules for text fields, buttons, and error messages, so I just followed those. For example, each input field has a label, helper text, and shows an error if the field is empty or incorrect. This makes it easier for users to complete the form without confusion.

Using this UI pattern helped a lot with the usability of the project. It made the interface simple for the patient and also reduced mistakes when filling out the form. Because the pattern is well known and tested, it also helped speed up the coding part, since I already knew how it should look and behave. In the end, this supports our goal of making the system fast and easy to use for both patients and staff.

## UsingPersonas
***By Fernando Canul Caballero***

We created a persona called Gavi Siceros, a 45–50 year old administrative assistant who works part time at the psychology clinic. She uses a desktop computer, a mobile phone, and a landline, and has an average level of tech skills. She manages many calls and appointment records every day, and often feels frustrated with confusing information and mistakes in the schedule.

This persona helped us make better UI decisions. For example, we designed a table view where Gavi can easily see two important lists: one for patients who already have a confirmed appointment, and another for patients who have requested an appointment but are still waiting. This helps her save time and avoid mistakes, since she can check the status of each patient at a glance. The table also allows filtering and sorting, which supports her daily routine and reduces the need to search manually.

Knowing her motivations, like helping patients, communicating clearly, and reducing stress in her work, helped us focus on making the interface fast and easy to use. We avoided complicated menus and used simple, readable elements. Thanks to this persona, we created a design that matches Gavi’s real tasks and helps her manage the clinic more efficiently.
