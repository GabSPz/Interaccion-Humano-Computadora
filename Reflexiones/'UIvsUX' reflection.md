# UI vs UX by Victor Rosado

First, in this article defines User Experience in the following way:
    "The cultivation of customer satisfaction and loyalty by optimally developng the usability and positive emotional response a visitor experiences with yout site"

This means how much people enjoy using the software and in this case the websites. A UX designer should ensure the user progresses through the system step by step until completing the task, so they must prioritize the user’s experience. Also, talk about how we can improve the user experience on websites, and which tools WordPress offers to work on thi.

Next, the user interface (UI) is defined in the following way:
    "UI is the physical and technical elements that enable the user to interact with the technology or product, i.e. the controls, buttons, etc. UI visually portrays the UX elements that have been laid out to provide a meaningful and enjoyable interaction with your user."
This about that it’s not just about the design tools we use, but also what the user engages with in the system. By focusing on these elements, we can create an appealing experience—which is crucial to keeping users on the site.

Now, in my project I can give these examples:
 * UX - In the department's current workflow, the focus is on improving efficiency for administrative staff. This isn’t about cutting steps, but optimizing the process to make it as seamless as possible—leveraging technology to simplify tasks, such as scheduling a first appointment

* UI - The UI plays a critical role since it’s the user’s direct interface with the system. Well-designed elements guide the user, helping them accomplish tasks with greater ease.

* UX - I think the use of notifications relates to UX, because for a patient using the system, it’s very convenient. It helps them manage their time if something comes up, which makes the system more satisfying to use.

* UI - According to the article, typography is a trend in UI. In my project, it’s essential for the appointment management system, because when the text is clear, it creates a clean and organized feeling in the system.
