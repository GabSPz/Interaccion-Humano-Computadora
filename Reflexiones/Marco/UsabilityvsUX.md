# Usability vs UX

The three concepts are related in that they all focus on improving the interaction between people and technology.
You could say that HCI is the theoretical and scientific basis that provides the principles and methods that support usability.
Usability is a pillar for UX, because a usable product is essential for a good experience, but UX goes deeper. UX expands the scope of HCI, while HCI focuses on technical interaction, UX incorporates subjective and contextual factors.

Since we are working on the appointment system for the psychology faculty, a specific difference between usability and UX would be that currently the pre-registration of patients is done in person, for which you have to call the clinic to schedule an appointment and the clinic can have your data so they can schedule another appointment for the evaluation of the patient and determine if they can attend to him. This would be an example of usability in which the user experience could be bad because you waste time doing a process that you would prefer to do from anywhere at any time.

Taking into account the previous point, a UX feature that could be included in our project could be that the user does not have the need to go through a process that could be considered time-consuming and somewhat unnecessary, such as scheduling an appointment to go to the data registry of the potential patient. We could see a way that this process could be carried out virtually or remotely without the need to schedule an appointment and go to the clinic.
