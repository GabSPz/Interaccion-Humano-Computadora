# Processing HCI

One of the biggest hurdles that software development teams often encounter is the challenge of integrating and verifying quality attributes that demand a lot of validation effort, like usability, accessibility, or security. These elements are vital for a great user experience, yet they frequently get overlooked or misunderstood during the development process, particularly in agile environments where the primary focus is on quickly and continuously delivering functional value.

Ironically, while agile methodologies promise flexibility and ongoing improvement, they can complicate the process of addressing these quality attributes if the team doesnâ€™t properly assess the effort needed for validation. This is where Lean UX comes into play as a powerful approach to balance quality requirements with the speed and adaptability that agile processes demand.

Sure, adopting Lean UX does require a considerable upfront investment in terms of coordination, mindset changes, and training, but the long-term advantages far surpass the initial costs:

- It fosters better team alignment and helps avoid wasting time on unvalidated features.
- It minimizes the chances of launching products that fail to meet genuine needs.
- It boosts user satisfaction by prioritizing their experience throughout development.

So, when it comes to advancing our project, embracing Lean UX could be a smart move.
