 # Reflecting on My Volunteering at DesignYourCity

Recently, I had the opportunity to volunteer for the "Design Your City" public consultation in Mérida. This initiative allows citizens to vote on public space projects—such as sports areas and green corridors—that they would like to see built or that require maintenance. The primary objective is to ensure that this voting process is accessible to the entire population of Mérida. However, designing a solution for such a broad spectrum of users, ranging from young people over 12 years old and students with a high affinity for technology to older adults, represents a considerable challenge.

To facilitate participation, the city implemented a system that combined online registration with physical stations where citizens could register and cast their vote.

During my participation, I identified several significant challenges:

The Barrier of Digital Maps: I realized how normalized the use of digital maps is for me, in contrast to the difficulty many citizens, especially older adults, experienced in locating or interpreting them. This was evident at the registration tables: when requesting addresses, both the voter and the staff were often unable to accurately locate the address on the map. As a result, the location of homes was often recorded approximately, prioritizing only that the selected address corresponded to the correct district for participation.

- Confusing Project Identification: I noticed that the absence of names on parks and spaces, replaced by numerical identifiers, made it difficult for many people to find the specific project they wanted to vote for. This caused confusion and frequently forced them to request assistance in locating their option.

- Lack of Option to Vote Invalid or Disinterested: I also observed that some citizens could not find projects of interest close to their homes. Not wanting to support any of the options presented, they found themselves with no alternative to spoil their vote or express their lack of interest in the available proposals.

- Ultimately, after my experience as a volunteer with "Design Your City," I came to a very clear conclusion: effective citizen participation goes far beyond simply enabling voting channels. If broad participation is truly desired, it is essential to carefully design systems so that they are intuitive and accessible to all users, from young people who are highly technologically familiar to older adults who may have less experience with these tools.

Because, realistically, the difficulties I witnessed—many people's confusion with digital maps, parks identified with numbers instead of names that were difficult to locate, or the inability to void a vote if no option was satisfactory—are not trivial matters. They are real obstacles that generate frustration, can lead to inaccurate information records, and, most worryingly, undermine citizens' trust and desire to participate.

From my perspective, if we don't prioritize the clarity of the process and the ease with which anyone can express their opinions in a simple manner, the fundamental purpose of these consultations is seriously compromised. Ultimately, how can we expect citizens to feel that their voice is truly important and that these initiatives are effective if participation itself becomes a barrier?
