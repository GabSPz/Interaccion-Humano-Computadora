The quality of the UI generated by ChatGPT-3.5 will largely depend on the promp provided by the developer or user. ChatGPT-3.5 can generate code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for simple or complex interfaces, but the visual design and user experience lack creativity without human intervention. Using ChatGPT-3.5 to produce a UI was relatively easy considering the extremely detailed input provided to it. The tool can generate full code or even images from design descriptions or functional requirements, but the views it generates with code are flat and lack UX. On the other hand, when attempting to create a UI in image format, the interface was too complex for the requested functionalities, although the design improved in terms of colors and aesthetics. However, ChatGPT does not automatically analyze accessibility or user behavior, which can result in interfaces that do not meet usability standards. With these types of tools, UX professionals won't be replaced; their role will evolve. AI will be able to handle repetitive tasks such as component generation, drafting, or brainstorming.
