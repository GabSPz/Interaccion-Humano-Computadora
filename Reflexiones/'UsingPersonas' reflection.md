# Using Personas by Victor Rosado

At this stage in the HCI course, we've completed numerous exercises involving design methodologies including Personas. Although the fundamental idea seems simple to grasp, the practical application proves significantly more complex and demanding.
The article presents many perspectives on this technique. We can say that the Persona represents our goal, so we must learn about that goal. It is also explained that a Persona can be a fictional representation of users, but it is created using real data gathered through research. Because of this, during the design process, we start to imagine how the product should work and look. Thatâ€™s why the real purpose of using this method is not just to describe a user, but to help us imagine the product.

In my project, we had the opportunity to interact with some of the final users of the system. Through conversations and interviews, we collected important information about how these users behave, what motivates them, and what their main skills and frustrations are in their job. We also learned about the context in which the system is used, and the surrounding factors that may affect them from time to time.

**Design Process & User Considerations**
Throughout our prototype development, our team consistently applied these insights to inform our design decisions. This collaborative approach ensured our main interface maintained intuitive familiarity for users from their first interaction.

**User-Centered Example: Gavi's Case**
A prime example is Gavi, an experienced secretary whose workflow preferences directly influenced our design. Key considerations included:

* Implementing rapid first-appointment registration to accommodate her high volume of cases

* Designing a visually intuitive calendar interface that bridges her transition from manual agenda use
These specific adaptations demonstrate our commitment to creating solutions that address real user needs while modernizing traditional workflows.
