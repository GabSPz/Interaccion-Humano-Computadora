# Usability vs UX

**By: Gabriel SÃ¡nchez Peraza**

In the field of Human-Computer Interaction, it is not a trivial task to distinguish between usability and user experience, even though both are closely related. Sources such as Don Norman or standards like ISO 9241-11 provide definitions of these concepts. They explain that while usability focuses on how well tasks are performed (functionality, learning, errors), UX also includes how the user feels while doing them (emotions, trust, perceived value).

`I believe that usability ensures tasks can be completed without obstacles or annoyances that can make it difficult a person from completing a task, while UX makes users feel valued, calm, and motivated. By combining both perspectives, we can design solutions that are innovative in a market filled with products that were not created with these two qualities in mind (e.g., SICEI).`
