# AI Tools

**By: Gabriel Sanchez Peraza**

**AI Tool Selected: Galileo AI** 

Galileo AI is an artificial intelligence-based design assistant that generates user interface designs from natural language instructions. It uses machine learning and a design knowledge base to produce interface designs and visual elements that match the requested functionality and style.

The quality of the UI generated by Galileo is impressive in terms of visual coherence, component alignment, and modern aesthetic. However, the designs often lack depth in interaction. For example, the tool doesnâ€™t always consider:

 * Edge cases (e.g., empty states, loading states).
 * Accessibility requirements.
 * Responsive behavior.

For me, using Galileo was surprisingly intuitive. You enter a prompt and within seconds, a detailed UI layout is generated. The tool is easy to use if you are already familiar with design vocabulary.

The UI includes basic usability elements like clear navigation, proper text alignment, and logical grouping of information. However, advanced usability principles like error prevention, feedback visibility, user control, and accessibility are not deeply implemented.

AI tools like Galileo AI show potential for speeding up UI production and offering visually appealing results with minimal input. However, `their limitations in addressing complex usability needs and emotional intelligence mean that they are tools, not replacements. I think the UX role will evolve into something more strategic and empathetic, where designers collaborate with AI, not compete against it.`
