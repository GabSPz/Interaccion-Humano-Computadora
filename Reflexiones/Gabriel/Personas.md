# Personas

**By Gabriel Sánchez Peraza**

**Selected Category: Needs**

We selected items from Lene Nielsen’s toolkit related to "personal stories." This item helps identify deep needs that are often not visible through demographic or functional data. In the context of the UADY clinic, these dimensions are especially critical.

The data collection method involved semi-structured interviews with potential users (secretaries), where personal stories were explored. Likewise, direct observations were made at the clinic's points of contact between patients and secretaries to capture non-verbal behaviors.

As our Persona, we chose Gavi, a secretary at the clinic with over 20 years of experience. She is an extroverted person who can communicate effectively and has a “clinical eye” to assess patients. Due to a bias in the digital system used to estimate the cost of treatment for patients, her "clinical eye" helps complete this task more accurately, improving patient satisfaction during their treatment process.

As part of user-centered design, Personas play an essential role in our product design process. Particularly in mental health contexts, `ignoring these needs leads to usability errors and can also negatively affect vulnerable people.`
