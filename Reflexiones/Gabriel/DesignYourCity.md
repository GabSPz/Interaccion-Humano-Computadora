# Design your City

**BY: Gabriel Sánchez Peraza**

As a Software Engineering student, volunteering at the “Design Your City” event in Mérida was a deeply eye-opening experience. I didn’t just observe how technology mediates citizen participation, but also how its failures directly affect directly people’s sense of legitimacy, inclusion, and even their mood.

The goal of the event was to allow citizens aged 12 and older to vote for urban projects, both digitally and in person. At first glance, it seemed like a well-planned project: online registration, help desks, digital maps, and tablets. However, once I was in direct contact with the users, the system revealed fundamental flaws that went far beyond basic functionality.

Many older adults who came to vote had trouble locating themselves on the digital maps. This tool, which for me as a student feels trivial, became an emotional barrier for them. Some got frustrated, while others felt clumsy. That’s when I realized that an interface is not just an input channel—it is, in itself, an emotional experience.

Designing a usable system for an online store may help increase sales, but designing a usable system for public voting can either strengthen or damage trust in democracy.

That’s where the importance of applying HCI principles lies, such as:

 * Visibility and feedback: The system must clearly show what each action does and what the consequences are.
 * Flexibility and control: Letting users undo a vote or choose only one space reinforces their autonomy.
 * Recognizing user diversity: From young digital natives to older adults with limited digital literacy, the design must be inclusive, not uniform.

I believe civic technology should not be measured only by its functionality, but also by its ability to build trust, autonomy, and emotional clarity. Design Your City showed us that it’s not enough for something "functional.” It must feel fair, clear, and accessible for everyone.
