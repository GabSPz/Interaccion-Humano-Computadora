## Lean UX

According to the source, **Lean UX** is defined as a technique that requires a lot of team collaboration, with constant feedback to help make quick decisions in a more cooperative way. It’s also mentioned that it’s used like agile methodologies, meaning it involves multiple iterations. Similarly, the user experience is highly prioritized since the user themselves will constantly validate the product to ensure it meets their needs.
Considering these key points, from my perspective, I don’t think it’s that easy to apply this technique. As mentioned before, it requires a lot of collaboration and, in my opinion, much more interaction among all team members. So, at least in our project, this technique doesn’t really exist.
With this in mind, I’d say that for it to be effective in our team, we would need to put in significant effort to organize ourselves, properly assign responsibilities, and ensure that all members complete their tasks. The closest tool we have for this is GitHub Projects, which serves as a kind of activity log for us.
I believe using this technique would require frequent deliveries of prototypes or progress updates for constant review. This means a lot of work with regular outputs to keep moving forward with tasks.
Changing so much about how the team works is a big challenge. I think, as you mentioned in one of my Software Quality Assurance classes, the biggest change would have to be in the organizational culture. It’s not easy to change the habits each team member has. I’d like to connect this to product quality—if we achieve good results with this technique, we can ensure our outcome is high-quality. This would mean the results are completely worth it, and even if costs go up (which they might), in the long run, it would greatly benefit the team, making their work much more professiona
