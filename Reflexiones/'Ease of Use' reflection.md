# Ease of Use by Victor Rosado

While reading a short article about myths related to producing quality software, here’s an interesting myth I discovered:

> *"Ease of use (ergonomics) defines programs that are easy to learn and align with an intuitive way of doing things. It is measured by observing the number of screens that interact with the user and their level of sophistication."*

This statement caught my attention because, throughout the course, we have studied **"ease of use"** in relation to *usability*, a concept explored in Human-Computer Interaction. We have concluded that usability is not simply about being *"easy to use"*—after all, what does *"easy to use"* truly mean?

The author points out that these metrics are simplistic and fail to capture real usability. A software application with many screens can be intuitive if well designed, while one with fewer screens can still be confusing. Similarly, as discussed in the article, usability is a complex attribute that cannot be reduced to simple objective measurements, such as counting screens—something we have also concluded in our studies.

So, in the end, **ease of use** isn’t just about counting screens or checking off some simple metrics. It’s about really understanding how people interact with the software—how the workflow feels, what kind of feedback users give, and whether it actually makes sense in different situations. It’s not something you can measure with just numbers; you have to see how it works in real life.
