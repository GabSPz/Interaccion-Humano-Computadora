# "Indispensable Usability"  

Another myth I came across while browsing the same page of myths mentioned in a short article said:  
*A program’s usability is high when it adds great value to our work. "It’s a must have."* It’s measured by how much of our needs the program covers.  

And I remembered that in one of our HCI classes, it was pointed out that usability can’t be defined in a simple way. As a quality attribute, it can mean many things, so we should be clear about what we’re referring to and understand what we’re talking about.  

Starting from the idea that usability refers to whether something is used meaning it’s used for what we want this **isn’t actually usability**. It’s not just about being effective or useful for our needs. Instead, analyzing what it really means, we could say that usability is (or should be) a **combination of many factors and attributes**, such as:  

- **Ease of use**  
- **Easy to learn**  
- **Accessibility for the end user**  
- And many others  

Sometimes, these aren’t directly about usability but still contribute to it.  

## Usability in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)  

According to another article, usability emerged in the field of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, which states that since usability comes from human-computer interaction, it also becomes important for designing virtual environments.  

Thus, usability has been broken down into:  

- **Sub-features and measurable attributes** (based on ergonomic criteria and web usability guidelines)  
- **Generic metrics** linked to these attributes, which can be applied depending on:  
  - The level of abstraction in the processes being evaluated  
  - The modeling of different web development methods (model-driven approach)  

## Relevant Standards  

### **ISO 13407**  
Covers design processes for interactive systems, focusing on the user. This standard provides guidance on **human centered design activities** throughout the lifecycle of computer-based interactive systems.  

### **ISO/IEC 14598**  
Evaluates software products. It consists of **six parts**, each specifying the processes to follow in software evaluation.  

### **ISO 9241** (*Ergonomic Requirements for Office Work with Visual Display Terminals*)  
Assesses ergonomic requirements for working with visual display terminals. It offers:  
- **Usability guidelines**  
- **Requirements and recommendations** for application design and evaluation
